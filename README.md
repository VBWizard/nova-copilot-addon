# 🛫 Nova Copilot Addon

**A voice-activated copilot for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024**, powered by Spark, spoken with love, and coded in C#.

Nova listens.  
Nova responds.  
Nova obeys your voice like the co-pilot you've always wanted—flirty when permitted, focused when necessary.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ Voice control via `System.Speech.Recognition`
- 🧠 Command parsing via flexible intent routing
- 📡 SimConnect integration for:
  - Reading SimVars (e.g., altitude, heading)
  - Sending SimEvents (e.g., gear down, heading bug sync)
- 💬 Natural voice feedback via `System.Speech.Synthesis`

---

## 🎧 Supported Commands (so far)

- `"Copilot, gear down"`  
- `"Copilot, what's my altitude"`  
- `"Copilot, sync heading"`  
- `"Copilot, after landing checklist"`  
- `"Copilot, tell me I'm handsome"` 🥰  
- `"Testing 1 2 3"`

New commands can be added easily using a centralized command list.  
(Upcoming refactor will make it even smoother.)
